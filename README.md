# Personal Finance App

With every bank account and credit card, an associated digital app is created to keep track of your activity and expenses.
I created this app to keep track of all my expenses in a centralized space instead of navigating between multiple apps.
Since every major financial company uses Plaid API to develop their apps, I should be able to re-create the functionalities of big finance apps like Capital One, TD Bank, Fidelity, Chase, etc... (surely right..?)

So I took it upon myself to experiment with Plaid's API and other components needed to create a modern dynamic app. (perhaps integrating a database and calling APIs using a background job)
